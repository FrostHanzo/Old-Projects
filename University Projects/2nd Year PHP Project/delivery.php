<p>The delivery is an essential process of our after-sales service, so We strive to deliver the products to our clients as efficiently as possible.
<br/>
For small orders of a few products, we use Royal Mail for our deliveries In the UK. For larger packages or where the value of the goods ordered exceeds &pound;10000, we try to arrange a dedicated courier service from DHL, UPS, TNT or other provider of such services in order to insure that our customers would receive their orders in a timely manner.
<br/>
If you have any issues or questions for our delivery process, please <a href="contact.php">contact us</a> and we will be more than happy to answer any questions that you might have.</p>

Introduction

This script is a demo coded up in PHP and MySQL forming part of my final year university module. It simulates a virtual library website that enables its users to browse and download books from. It is accompanied by a huge technical report that formed a large part of my final year grade, but as it is confidential, I have no right to share it here. Since the code is also copyrighted and belongs exclusively to City University London, here I have shared just the explanation of the code and a link to the working script.
